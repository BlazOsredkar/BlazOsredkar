### Hi there. I'm Bla≈æ. üëã


UI/UX Designer | Full Stack Developer | React Enthusiast
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate UI/UX designer with a knack for creating stunning and intuitive user interfaces. I also dabble in coding and enjoy taking on full stack web development projects. With expertise in React and NestJS, I strive to build seamless and responsive applications that leave a lasting impression.

üé® UI/UX Design

I'm a student and aspiring UI/UX designer, constantly immersing myself in the world of design and steadily honing my skills. While I may still be in the early stages of my design journey, I embrace every opportunity to learn and grow.

I believe that the best way to learn is through hands-on practice, and I'm excited to explore new design challenges and collaborate with experienced designers to accelerate my growth. With every project, I strive to push my creative boundaries, refine my skills, and gain valuable insights that will shape my future as a designer.

üíª Full Stack Web Development

Coding is another passion of mine, and I love working on full stack web development projects. I believe that having a solid understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies enables me to create cohesive and efficient applications. My go-to tech stack includes React for the front end and NestJS for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications. In addition to my UI/UX design skills, I also have experience working with databases, which adds an extra layer of depth to my full stack web development projects. I'm well-versed in using databases to create robust and efficient applications.

Here are the databases I have experience with:

PostgreSQL
MariaDB

Understanding how to design and optimize database structures allows me to develop applications that store and retrieve data seamlessly. Whether it's creating complex queries or ensuring data integrity, I prioritize the performance and reliability of the database layer.

By integrating my knowledge of databases with my UI/UX design skills, I can create user-centric applications that not only look visually appealing but also provide a smooth and efficient user experience.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Here's a list of technologies and languages I frequently work with:

React (JavaScript/TypeScript)
NestJS (Node.js/TypeScript)
C++
C#
I'm always eager to expand my skill set and learn new technologies to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.

üå± Currently Learning

Continuous learning is crucial to my growth as a designer and developer. Some of the technologies and concepts I'm currently focusing on include:

Next.js
