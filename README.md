# Hello, I'm [Blaž] from Slovenia! 👋

## 🎨 UI/UX Designer | 💻 Full Stack Developer | ⚛️ React Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate UI/UX designer with a love for crafting delightful designs, and a budding full stack developer who enjoys building responsive websites.

### 💡 UI/UX Design

I believe that design goes beyond aesthetics—it's about enhancing the user experience. As a student, I'm constantly learning and growing in the world of design. My goal is to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces that captivate and delight users. 🌟

### 💻 Full Stack Web Development

I thrive on full stack web development projects, leveraging my skills in **React** and **NestJS**. From front-end to back-end, I strive to build seamless applications that provide a smooth user experience. I'm also experienced in working with databases like **PostgreSQL** and **MariaDB** to ensure efficient data management. 💪

### 🌱 Continuous Learning

I have an insatiable appetite for knowledge and always stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the industry. In addition to UI/UX design and full stack development, I also have a strong understanding of how **operating systems work**. I can troubleshoot and fix computers, and I'm proficient in macOS, Windows, and Linux environments. 🚀
